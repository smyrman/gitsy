===================
Whait is <*GiTsY*>?
===================

Gitsy is a simple and stupid backup and synchronization tool on top of Git. It
allows you to push and pull multiple repositories between a local and a remote
host, (or between two local hosts), and to automatically add and commit all
changes before each push.

*WARNING*: This script was created for my own private usage, but it might be of
use to others as well (For example you).

Typically I would recommend to use this tool for syncing your documents and
configuration files, but not for large binary files such as music and videos (or
anything of that kind). I would also NOT recommend that you use it to sync your
entire home directory.

===================
Install & configure
===================

1. First of all, git must be installed and configured, i.e., after installing
   git, issue::

   $ git config --global user.name "your name"
   $ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
   $ git config --global color.ui auto # optional!

2. Copy 'gitsy' to somewhere on your $PATH.

3. copy 'gitsyrc' to "$HOME/.gitsyrc".

4. modify .gitsyrc to your liking.

5. make sure that the directory described by REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_USER and
   REMOTE_DIR exist.

=====
Usage
=====

Given that you have used ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id to allow no-password login
to the remote host (Not required, but recommended as it will save you from
typing your password a million times), You are ready to go!

Adding a directory to be synced by gitsy
----------------------------------------

1. To setup a new directory to be synced by gitsy, do the following on your
   local machine (given that the folder $home/project1 exist, and include some
   content other then empty folders)::

    $ gitsy init project1

2. Next thing is to push the repository to the remote host::

    $ gitsy push

This command will set up a git repository at "$HOME/project1", and a 'bare'
repository at "$REMOTE_USER@$REMOTE_HOST:$REMOTE_DIR/project1.git".
It will also use 'sed' to add "project1" to the REPOS variable in "$HOME/.gitsyrc".

*IMPORTANT*: If you wan't to initialize and add a repository for sync, not
located in $HOME, you must do this manually::

    $ cd path/to/repo/projectx
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin user@example.com:your_repos_dir/projectx
    $ ssh user@example.com git init --bare your_repos_dir/projectx
    $ cd
    $ edit .gitsyrc # add path/to/repo/projectx to REPOS (which is a bash array).


But that only gives me backup :*( I wanted sync!
------------------------------------------------

1. On a second local machine (say for instance at the server configured to
   REMOTE_HOST in 5), setup gitsy as described in INSTALLATION. Set up
   REMOTE_HOST="", REMOTE_DIR="$HOME/repos" (or whatever folder you use instead
   of repos).

2. Since 'project1' already exist in $HOME/repos, we will now issue::

    $ gitsy clone project1

This will clone project1 to $HOME, and add project1 to REPOS.


The rest of gitsy's commands
----------------------------

* gitsy status
* gitsy pull
* gitsy help

====================
OH NO, I SCREWED UP!
====================

Gitsy is simple and stupid, and if you do soemthing wrong, (like configuring an
invalid host name) you will have to fix it yourself. Some recomendations::

    $ edit $HOME/.gitconfig
    $ edit path/to/your/project/.git/config
    $ git help
